## Task Description

We want you to build a URL shortener service. The application can be used to turn a long link into a shorter one (e.g.
https://www.stoik.com/barometre-ifop-2025-eti-risque-cyber → https://localhost/ABC123) that redirects to the original URL.

It looks simple, but it quickly raises real-world questions around reliability, security, data modeling, and scalability.

Your goal is to build a simple, clean, working version that we’ll review together during the interview.
